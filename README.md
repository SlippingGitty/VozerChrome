# VozerChrome
Are you sick of your internet browser not giving you the flexibility or extensiveness that you demand from it? Do you ever feel that your internet browser isn’t doing it’s best to keep your data hidden from trackers and hackers? Do you feel like the modern web has gotten too bloated with fancy animations and advertisements? Do you think that websites like Facebook, Twitter, and reddit are trampling on your first amendment rights?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, chances are you are an insufferable person. VozerChrome aims to make your travels on the internet much more complicated then it should be by eradicating newer developments in web design, and replacing them with garbage that is half baked and developed by basement dwellers. But hey, at least the project is GLP v3, which is like, freedom or something like that. 

## Features

* VozerChrome comes with it’s own built-in adblocker, updated on a semi-regular basis. We believe that big business does not have the right to control what you see, or the right to collect information on you to give you “more relevant results”. If you do not want your website’s ads to be blocked, you can donate at https://slippinggitty.github.io/.
* The modern internet is too colorful, flashy, and is filled with many slow animations, preventing you from being productive. VozerChrome solves this by not loading style sheets or javascript at all.
* VozerChrome blocks websites we believe tramples on your right to free speech.
* The default search engine for VozerChrome is a random Searx instance I made while I was bored.
* As the head maintainer of VozerChrome, I feel very humbled to say that we are the first internet browser developed by a small, independent, decentralized team of people, free from the corporate environment. [Here is my workstation!](https://files.catbox.moe/fkodr7.jpg)
* VozerChrome is maintained by YOU! Is there an option that you feel is missing? A new feature is a pull request away.
