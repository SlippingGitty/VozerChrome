there is absolutely no plans for vozerchrome to be a legitimate project

perhap use ungoogled chromium or librewolf with ublock orgin or smth

https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium

https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/

qutebrowser is also quite okay if you want that 

https://qutebrowser.org/
